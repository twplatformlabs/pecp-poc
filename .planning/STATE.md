# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-27)

**Core value:** A team can go from zero to provisioned infrastructure by writing a YAML and running `pecp apply` — without knowing which AWS account they're in, which pipeline runs, or which ticket gets filed.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation + Contracts

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation + Contracts)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-28 -- Phase 01 planning complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Adapter interface (AdapterBase ABC) must be locked from AWS-complexity perspective before any mock is written — see ADPT-01
- Phase 1: Demo script written before any implementation begins — prevents CRUD-only demo pitfall
- Phase 1: RequestContext auth stub hardcoded but structured for JWT drop-in — no auth enforcement in PoC
- [Phase ?]: Demo team name is toxins-research — revised from initial payments per user feedback before plan approval

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- PECPSalesforce and PECPAem resource specs are stubs pending product/PE team input — mock adapter designs will be placeholder until specs are confirmed (Phase 2)
